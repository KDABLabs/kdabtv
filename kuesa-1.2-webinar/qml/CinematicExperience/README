INTRO
==========

This UX demo application presents some graphical features of Qt5. 
The name 'Cinematic Experience' reflects how it's possible to build user 
interfaces with increased dynamics.


RUNNING
==========

To run this application you need relatively recent build of Qt5:
- http://qt-project.org
- http://qt.gitorious.org/qt/qt5

There are two different ways to run the application:

1) If your target platform contains 'qmlscene' binary, just use it:
---
cd Qt5_CinematicExperience
[path to Qt5]/qtbase/bin/qmlscene Qt5_CinematicExperience.qml
---

2) Alternatively, a simple launcher is provided to start the application:
---
cd Qt5_CinematicExperience
[path to Qt5]/qtbase/bin/qmake
make
./Qt5_CinematicExperience
---

The run application in fullscreen mode, use '--fullscreen' parameter for 
qmlscene or launcher. If you want to tweak the window resolution, 
modify 'width' and 'height' properties in Qt5_CinematicExperience.qml
